# Web Basics- Prototype Pollution

## Docker Installation

If you do not have docker installed or are using an older version, you can follow the steps to install it from the link below:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/

## Challenge Setup

### filestorage

Go  to challenge directory and run the following commands to build and run docker container:

1. Build the docker image (*make sure to be same directory as the dockerfile).*

```docker
docker build -t filestorage .
```

1. Run the created created image as a container:

```docker
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 filestorage
```

To stop the docker container, simply run the following commands:

1. List out the running containers and copy the ID of the container.

```docker
docker container ls
```

1. Kill the container using its ID.

```docker
docker kill <CONTAINER_ID>
```

### funnylogin

Because there wasnâ€™t any issues with the YAML configuration file, we can just use docker compose for this one.

To build and run the container just use the following command:

```docker
docker compose up --build
```

To stop the docker container from running enter the following command:

```docker
docker compose down
```
